   # WHO AM I

  My name is Danti. I'm a self-taught software engineer and I cut chores down to call. I have workable knowledge of how to better estimate what I need to complete a task, organize myself and achieve what I set out to do with a project.
  
  I am quite fluent in C. Most of it's descendants, such as C++, C# and Java , are similar enough that I can switch to them without much trouble. I occasionally dabble in OpenGL and GLSL, and know a fair bit of Python. I write bash if I have to but for the most part I prefer writting perl.
  
  # WHAT I AM WORKING ON
  
  - `peso` yet unpublished: A low-level programming language for writting grids of multi-tasking objects. It uses it's own abstraction mechanisms to allow selective inheritance, with a heavy focus on making it easier to produce more flexible, reusable code.
  - `avtomat` my Perl reimplementation of make. Yes. It's designed to automate build processes on groups of projects, as well as sharing code between them. It also uses FFI::Platypus to generate Perl bindings to the compiled C code; further languages to be added as needed.
  - `ce` champs' editor, a WIP code and hexdump editor for X11 terminals. Implements keyboard handling with callbacks for key up, key held and key released events.
  - `help` a set of string utilities for console pretty-printing, included with a `-h` message generator. 
  
  # CONTACT ME
  
  I'm open for remote work, either paid or as a volunteer if the project is interesting enough. I read my emails; you may contact me at dantepaola25@gmail.com, spambots beware.
